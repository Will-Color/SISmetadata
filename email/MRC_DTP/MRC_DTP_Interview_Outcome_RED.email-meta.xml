    <textOnly>Dear {!Student_Programme__c.Student__c},

Thank you for attending the interview for the LSTM - Lancaster Medical Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership scheme.

We have now had the opportunity to consider all of the candidates. The decision has been a difficult one, as the overall standard of shortlisted candidates was extremely high. The panel discussed their views and assessments and jointly drew up a list of applicants in merit order.

After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that, on this occasion, you have not been successful. If you are interested in studying at LSTM, you can still apply for a postgraduate research degree (which is not MRC-DTP). You will find all the information on the LSTM website. Applications and enquiries should be sent to the Research Degrees Administrator (pgr@lstmed.ac.uk).

Should you wish to speak to someone regarding your application, please contact the MRC Doctoral Training Partnership team (mrcdtp@lstmed.ac.uk).

Thank you for should in a interest in LSTM. We wish you all the best in your future endeavours.

Yours sincerely,


MRC DTP Team
