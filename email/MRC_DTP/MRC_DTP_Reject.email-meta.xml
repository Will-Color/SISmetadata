    <textOnly>Dear {!Student_Programme__c.Student__c},

Thank you for your application to the LSTM - Lancaster Medical Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership scheme.

We have received many applications and after careful review, we regret to inform you that, on this occasion, you have not been short-listed for an interview.

If you are interested in studying at LSTM, you can still apply for an alternative Postgraduate Research Programme. You will find all the information at http://www.lstmed.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/how-to-apply-for-a-research-degree. Applications and enquiries should be sent to the Research Degrees Administrator (pgr@lstmed.ac.uk).

Should you wish to speak to someone regarding your MRC DTP application, please contact the MRC Doctoral Training Partnership Team (mrcdtp@lstmed.ac.uk).

Thank you for showing an interest in studying at LSTM. We wish you all the best in your future endeavours.

Yours sincerely,


MRC DTP Team
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine</textOnly>
