    <textOnly>Dear {!Student_Programme__c.Student__c},

Thank you for attending the interview for the LSTM - Lancaster Medical Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership scheme.

We have now had the opportunity to consider all of the candidates. The decision has been a difficult one, as the overall standard of shortlisted candidates was extremely high. The panel discussed their views and assessments and jointly drew up a list of applicants in merit order.

After careful consideration, the panel decided to add you to a reserve list, to fill posts that my arise should any candidates decline the offer of a place or subsequently withdraw. Again this will be done in accordance with the merit order.

We would appreciate it if you could please confirm in writing that you are happy to be added to the reserve list by emailing the MRC Doctoral Training Partnership Team (mrcdtp@lstmed.ac.uk) by midday on Monday 25th January 2016.

Yours sincerely,


MRC DTP Team
