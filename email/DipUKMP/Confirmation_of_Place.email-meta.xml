    <textOnly>Dear Doctor,


We have received your registration fee for the DipUKMP and you can now begin study and access the relevant systems. As an off-site student of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, you can access the Virtual Learning Environment (BrightSpace) and student intranet, plus the library e-resources.


Please use BrightSpace to access resources to help you achieve the learning outcomes for the DipUKMP, including:

- Student handbook

- List of learning outcomes that you need to demonstrate that you have met

- Details of how you are assessed

- Resources to help with reflective writing for the written assignment

- Guidance for you and your educational supervisor


Please also use BrightSpace to contact LSTM staff about any relevant matters and to network with each other. There are some introductory activities and a profile to complete when you first log on.
