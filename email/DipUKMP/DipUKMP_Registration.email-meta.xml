The student intranet provides useful information on services and support for students. It also gives you access to Office 365 allowing you to download Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint and access your LSTM email account. It is important you check your LSTM email account regularly, as we will send all future correspondence to this address.


Brightspace: http://brightspace.lstmed.ac.uk


Brightspace is LSTM&apos;s virtual learning environment (VLE). This is an online space dedicated to the DipUKMP, which contains all essential information for the programme. Here you will find educational material, key documents and updates on important NHS issues. There are resources to help you succeed in the programme and, in particular, in the written assignment. You can communicate with fellow MTI doctors on the programme through Brightspace and also with staff. Assignments are also submitted through Brightspace. Please start using it and familiarise yourself with its content.



If you have any difficulty accessing any of our systems, please email dipukmp@lstmed.ac.uk


Yours sincerely
