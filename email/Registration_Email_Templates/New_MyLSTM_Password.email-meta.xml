    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},




Since you applied for the {!Student_Programme__c.Programme__c} using our application form, we have set up an online MyLSTM account for you.



You can access your MyLSTM account at: https://mylstm.force.com/students/LSTMLogin



Your username is: {!Contact.Personal_Email__c}




The password for your MyLSTM account will be sent in a separate email, which you should receive shortly. If you do not receive your password within the next 24 hours, first check your spam folder, then contact us to request a new password.




Before the {!Student_Programme__c.Programme__c} starts on {!Student_Programme__c.Programme_Start_Date__c}, we will send you instructions on how to log into your MyLSTM account to Pre-Register online.



We look forward to welcoming you to LSTM.




Yours sincerely,
