    <textOnly>Dear {!Student_Programme__c.Student__c}
Please complete online Pre-Registration for the {!Student_Programme__c.Programme__c}



We look forward to welcoming you as a student on the {!Student_Programme__c.Programme__c}. The programme runs from

{!Student_Programme__c.Programme_Start_Date__c} until {!Student_Programme__c.Programme_End_Date__c}.



Pre-Registration

You need to Pre-Register before you arrive, to gain access to your LSTM email account and Brightspace (the Virtual Learning Environment).


To Pre-Register, simply click here to log into your MyLSTM account, using the email address and password you used to set up your MyLSTM account and apply for the programme.
Once you have logged in to MyLSTM, follow the &apos;Register Online&apos; link and enter the required pre-registration information to complete the process.
You will need to provide your term time address (if known), your next of kin details and upload a photograph of yourself (there is an option to crop your photo).


When you have completed Pre-Registration, you will be provided with your new LSTM email address and a new password to access LSTM systems. Please remember to keep a note of your new LSTM email address and password.

{!Student_Programme__c.Programme__c} is a paperless course. This allows us to keep our costs as low as possible and is in line with LSTM&apos;s commitment to the principles of education for sustainable development - you will be able to access this material on Brightspace. All material is copyrighted to LSTM and is for your personal use only. You will require the use of a laptop/iPad to view teaching material during lectures, so please make sure you bring a reliable one with you.

Failure to Pre-Register online before you arrive at LSTM will delay your access to LSTM systems and course materials.

If you have any problems with the Pre-Registration process, please contact us via email at MyLSTM@lstmed.ac.uk.




Yours sincerely
Professional Courses Unit</textOnly>
