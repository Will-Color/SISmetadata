    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}



I am currently reviewing the status of applications for the MSc in {!Student_Programme__c.Programme__c} at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and I notice that there are still conditions of your offer outstanding.




The deadline for meeting the conditions of your offer has now passed but, if you could provide further information regarding any progress made in meeting the conditions of your offer, I may be able to grant an extension for you.




I look forward to your response.



Kind regards
