Thank you for submitting your application for the MSc in {!Student_Programme__c.Programme__c} at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
 
I am currently processing your application and I notice that you have not provided a copy of your .......
 
Please could I ask you to forward a copy of ....... so that I can upload it to your application.  You can send this as an attachment to an email addressed to: MyLSTM@lstmed.ac.uk
 
Your application will then be forwarded to the Director of Studies for consideration.  The review process takes up to 15 working days but I will let you know the outcome of your application as soon as possible afterwards.
 
In the meantime, although this is not required in order for your application to be considered, please may I draw your attention to our English language requirements: http://www.lstmed.ac.uk/study/how-to-apply/language-requirements  Applications can be considered without an English certificate but, should your application be successful, then any offer made would be subject to you providing evidence of English at the required level.  
 
If you already hold a certificate, such as a Tanzania Certificate of Secondary Education at the required level, then please could you also forward a copy of this so I can add it to your application.
 
If I can be of any further assistance please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
